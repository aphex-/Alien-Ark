# Alien Ark

Alien Ark is a game made for the #libGDXjam by www.nuke-the-moon.com

This repro was released in a hurry. ~~More informaion will follow as soon as possible.~~
If you are interested in the procedural planet generation used in Alien Ark better take a look at  https://github.com/aphex-/opusproto This is a library we wrote and used for this. 
The Alien Ark code was made under time pressure and for this reason it contains some programing bad practices. Dont judge us too hard..
